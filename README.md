# Meet Me Halfway
## Digital Crafts group project  by John, Jecce, Daniela  and Alina
*You are welcome to check out the project here:* ADD ADDRESS!


###Technical Requirements

* Implement a Responsive Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices at 360px, 768px, and 1200+ px wide
* Access at least 2 remote APIs (data mashup!)
* Use fewer than 3 global variables (numerous constants are fine, but should be limited to primitive values like numbers and strings)
* You must host your site on AWS


Our application was build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Data is generated using GoogleMap APIs  and ZomatoAPI. Four participants collaborated using GitHub. In addition to front-end development, this project allows us to master  version control  habits and merge conflict-solving skills.
The idea of the application is to enable user to  find perfect meeting point in the middle between two addresses both time-wise or distance-wise.
