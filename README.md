# Meet Me Halfway
## Digital Crafts group project  by John, Jesse, Daniela  and Alina
*You are welcome to check out the project here:* ADD ADDRESS!


### Technical Requirements:
* Implement a Responsive Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices at 360px, 768px, and 1200+ px wide
* Access at least 2 remote APIs (data mashup!)
* Use fewer than 3 global variables (numerous constants are fine, but should be limited to primitive values like numbers and strings)
* You must host your site on AWS



### Technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* API

Our application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Data is generated using GoogleMap APIs,DarkSky weather API and ZomatoAPI. Four participants collaborated using GitHub. In addition to front-end development, this project allows us to master  version control  habits and merge conflict-solving skills.
The idea of the application is to enable user to  find perfect meeting point in the middle between two addresses both time-wise or distance-wise.

## How it Works:
User enters his address and friend's address and pushes "Meet Halfway!" button
